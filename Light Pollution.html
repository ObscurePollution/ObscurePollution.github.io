<p class="standard">Light pollution, as the name implies is an overuse or misuse of lights and
 especially at night. While they may seem harmless or absent from our lives, 
in most developed and semi-developed countries lights are often overused, as
 seen in the image above. If you have access to the internet, you most likely 
experience this pollution to an extent. One great way to see just how much 
light goes into the night sky is with this interactive website of the world 
map at night <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/Artificial-light">here</a>. Things like excessive
 streetlights, lamps, bright billboards, bright light bulbs and more are
 examples of light pollution. According to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/light-pollution/">National Geographic</a>, there are
 4 main kinds of light pollution; glare, light trespass, clutter and skyglow.
 Glare is focused horizontal light with blinding health risks
 (such as a bright street lamp when driving), light trespass is when light is
 too strong and ends up reaching to areas not meant to be lit (like a lamp 
post’s light extending into someone’s home), clutter is when there are too 
many lights, confusing your senses (like the side of buildings in metropolitan
 areas) and finally skyglow is light bouncing up into the once clear night sky
 (as seen in the image above). Aside from hurting the environment by wasting 
energy needed to sustain these unnecessary lights, light pollution also has
 adverse health effects for humans and animals as well.

<h2>Impacts and cause of light pollution:</h2>

<style>

<p class="standard">Light can be a significant factor in human and our ecosystems health.
 This is because it disrupts and confuses the circadian rhythm, which is 
responsible for our behaviour, body temperature, mental health and production
of hormones. Most commonly it creates a higher risk of sleep deprivation which 
leads to anxiety, depression, obesity, migraines and seasonal affective 
disorder. However, in more extreme cases an overexposure to light has been 
linked to some types of cancer. Hormones such as melatonin are excellent at
 suppressing and killing cancer cells before they develop but can only be 
produced with a low light environment when sleeping. So much so that in 2007, 
the international agency for cancer research listed night work as a
 “probable human carcinogen”, for its link to breast cancer and prostate
 cancer patients. Similarly, animals also feel the effects of lights at
 night. Many insects, birds and frogs are heavily attracted to light,
 resulting in them being easily preyed upon, in an area they shouldn’t be
 and/or exhausting them to death. Others feel the opposite effect and are 
repelled by our artificial light, thus creating a form of habitat loss and 
forced migration. Both of these kill and boost the populations of certain
 animals, ultimately resulting in an unbalanced ecosystem and loss of species.

<p class="standard">
Despite these dangers light pollution is still extremely common across the
 developed world, but why? you might ask. Well, it’s mostly because of 
urbanisation and globalisation, when used correctly, artificial lights are 
extremely helpful in navigation and safety as well as extending our days so 
we can be more productive. Unfortunately, many light sources in modern times
 are far too bright, badly designed or placed unnecessarily. The biggest and 
most common causes are street lamps, stadiums, fireworks, billboards, cars,
 and more. Luckily, light pollution is one of the easiest pollution to 
remedy, which are listed below.

<ul style="font-size:20px">

<li>Try your best to buy IDA approved light fixtures, the International 
dark sky association values lightbulbs by how much energy they use, their 
brightness, amount of light created, etc… As the name suggests, this
 association tries to find the balance between helpful lights and harmful 
lights.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Compact fluorescent and LED lights extend less than other bulb types, thus 
reducing light trespass, and they are also the most energy effective bulbs.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Install timers, sensors and other devices that automatically switch off 
lights as to not waste electricity and provide light when it’s not needed.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Turn off lights when not in use. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Use an eye mask if your bedroom has unavoidable light from light
 trespass pollution. This will reduce the impacts of light when sleeping
 and is extremely cheap to implement.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Get dimmers for lights to reduce the effects of glare and therefore avoid 
eye damage.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Buy warm coloured light bulbs, (more yellow than blue) as blue lights have
 been shown to damage eyes and have stronger effects of glare. Additionally, 
blue light has a higher capability of skyglow than any other colours.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Remove any unnecessary light sources to save electricity and contribute 
less to light pollution.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Raise awareness about light pollution or teach others around you about its
 dangers and how to prevent them.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Finally, an easier way to reduce light pollution on a larger scale without 
being a lawmaker, manufacturer of light bulbs, politician etc, is to donate 
to charities that aim to reduce light pollution of all kinds. A great
 candidate for this is <a href="https://www.darksky.org">The International 
Dark Sky Association</a>, although there
 are many others.
