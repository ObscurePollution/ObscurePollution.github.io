Noise pollution, also known as sound pollution is any kind of unwanted 
noise or an excessive amount of noise that affects human and animal health.
 Even though sound can seem like just a minor annoyance or a temporary
 disturbance, long exposure to sound such as from a construction site,
 airport or other loud environment can cause long term damages. Unfortunately, 
excessive noise is extremely common as show in <a href="https://blog.arcadia.
com/15-facts-stats-noise-pollution/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC1253729/>this article</a> 
by NCBI national health (national center for biotechnology information), found 
that 30 million workers in America were consistently exposed to harmful
 amounts of sound, more than 10% of their population in the year 2005
 (when it was conducted). <a href="https://blogs.voanews.com/science-world/
2012/09/11/noise-pollution-takes-toll-on-health/">Another study</a> by the US
 Administration’s Traffic Noise Model found similar findings as 11.3% of
 daytime civilians encountered detrimental levels of noise and 3.7% at night
 in College Park, Georgia. Noise is constantly around us, but when it gets 
too loud and too frequent it becomes a threat to our health
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Impacts and Causes</h2>
<p class="standard">
The table below provides a good overview of how loud sounds are in reference 
 to real world items and their increasing health risks the louder it gets:
</p>

<style>
p.footnote {
font-size: 12px;
}
</style>

<p class="footnote">
*When viewing the table, keep in mind that the decibel scale is logarithmic
 to a factor of 10, meaning that any 10 dB skip is essentially 2 times louder
 and 10 times more intense than its predecessor. A real life example is that 
to make something 2 times as loud, you would need 10 of it, like 10 speakers
 to create twice the loudness of 1 speaker. Also, there are 3 main factors of
 how loud and detrimental a sound is, its volume, distance from the sound and
 time spent in the sound, so the exact volume may vary depending on distance. 
Lastly, green is safe/healthy while red is unhealthy/harmful.

To summarise the physical health risks, constant exposure to loud noise can 
create higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart diseases, 
result in lost hearing, high blood pressure, trouble sleeping and heart 
arrhythmia. But noise carries with it issues to our mental state as well,
 commonly headaches and lack of focus, along with anxiety, stress, mental
 instability, fatigue and improper cognitive development in children, although
 these are more extreme. About 75-85dB is when sound is considered harmful, 
anything beforehand is safe even for long exposure (unless sleeping, in which 
case 45dB and above is harmful).
<br>
<br>
Generally places with heavy duty technology, explosions, transportation and 
many people are the loudest of environments. Another great way to gauge how 
loud an area is, is by seeing how urbanised it is because most of the loudest
 sounds are man-made, including people themselves. Some common environments 
that are loud are construction sites, airports, busy roads and crowds of
 people.

<h2>What can we do against this?</h2>

<table cellspacing="10px">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">
<p class="standard">
Luckily, noise pollution is one of the easiest pollutants to fix for yourself and your neighbours, some of the easiest small scale steps include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Close your windows</li>
<li>Cover your ears if it’s an immediate, sudden noise </li>
<li>Put on earplugs</li>
<li>Back away further from the noise</li>
<li>Place your head into a noise absorbing object, like a pillow</li>
<li>Shut the door</li>
<li>Turn off or lower the volume of electronic devices</li>
<li>Counteract the unpleasant sound with pleasant sounds</li>
</ul>

<p class="standard">
However, if you live in a permanently noisy area, more long term solutions 
should be incorporated, these include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Create awareness about noise pollution because most neglect it or
 understate it on account of sound being temporary and invisible</li>
<li>Have a more enclosed house design, with more walls separating each room</li>
<li>Get acoustics on the walls to absorb and contain sound, carpets have 
the same effect but for the floor</li>
<li>Get curtains</li>
<li>Muffle loud sounds on sound source itself</li>
<li>And of course don’t create loud noises yourself, for the sake of your health and those around you</li>
</ul>
