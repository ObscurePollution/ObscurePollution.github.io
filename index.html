<b>What is pollution?</b>
<br>
<br>
According to National Geographic; pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. This may be through hurting the animals,  landscape or any other negative environmental impacts (depending on which type of pollution). Speaking of which, the term “pollution” is very general which is why types of them are created, which include air, water, land...which are the most well-known. However, the focus of this website is on more obscure forms of pollution.


</li>
<br>

<li>
<b>When does pollution occur?</b>
<br>
<br>
Pollution occurs virtually all the time, even before the age of industrialisation. This is because many things can be considered pollutants, even natural pollutants exist like volcanic gas. Even though this is the case,
 in modern times pollution has been especially rampant due to man-made causes (smoke, factories, littering, overfishing, nuclear waste and more) which were byproducts of globalisation and our growing population.
</li>
<br>

<li>
<b>Why does pollution matter? (as well as obscure forms of pollution)</b>
<br>
<br>
Ecologically, pollution hurts and even kills millions of animals and plants from the seas to the sky. As you can imagine, this devastates ecosystems and will eventually leave animals extinct. On the other hand, we suffer from adverse health effects and premature deaths. For instance, inhaling smoke and dangerous fumes lead to respiratory diseases. Ultimately these effects lead to climate change/global warming which would be catastrophic. With that out of the way, obscure forms of pollution such as those covered on this website are important as they have these detrimental effects too, but are unjustly reported less about, to the point of some people not knowing about them at all.
</li> 
<br>

<li>
<b>Who is responsible for pollution and who does it affect?</b>
<br>
<br>
As implied before, pollution can and is created by everyone to an extent. In terms of industries to blame, the energy, transportation, agriculture and residential sectors have been most responsible. Afterwards these pollutants go on to affect us all, just to different amounts. Unfortunately, children, the elderly, immuno-compromised and people in poverty suffer from it the most. For the first 3 demographics, it’s due to the fragility of their immune system because of decay or young development. Lastly for those in impoverished regions, their conditions of life often subject them to the worst of pollutants, that only those with adequate money can escape.
</li>
<br>

<li>
<b>How can we reduce/prevent pollution in general?</b>
<br>
<br>
We can lessen the effects of pollution as individuals by using renewable energy sources, more energy effective technology (no burning or other open fires), adopting a vegan lifestyle and using less of earth's resources. But this is best done as a group, which is why another, more indirect method of reducing pollution is to raise awareness of its dangers, alongside how to avoid them. Companies and manufacturers can substitute environmentally harmful materials, implement a more environmentally friendly supply chain and dispose of waste more environmentally efficiently.
</li>
<br>

<li>
<b>Where does pollution start and where does it spread?</b>
<br>
<br>
If we were to quantify nations, China, America, India and Russia are the biggest contributors to pollution. Mostly, this is due to these countries being the biggest manufacturers of products and agriculture while using cheaper, yet more environmentally detrimental energy sources, such as fossil fuels. After it is created, pollution spreads all across the globe and in many forms, which are elaborated on in the websites to the right. Pollutants then spread through the use of natural processes, such as the rain cycle, the food chain, winds, tides and international trading.
